One Touch Photo Note with Reminder and Auto Delete for Android

Status: Mockup
http://benjaminhenn.de/letspicapp/mockup

Who can help me with this project? I am a freelance cameraman and got no idea of coding. Any help is very much welcome. Thanks!

Why this App? I found it extremely helpful to take pictures from paper notes, things to remember, things to buy and so on. I use to do that with the native photo app from Android. All pictures are saved together in one folder.

The Problem: I cant find the important pictures in the mess of all the other pictures i took.

The Solution: An app for the important pictures.

The Functions: Take a photo with just one touch. Like with the native photo app on Android or IOS.
Than choose to:

1.) Label the picture with text
2.) Remind me (Set date and time. The picture will show up with sound as an reminder)
3.) Delete after (Set time)

The pictures are sorted in a clearly arranged gallery. From the gallery you can open, share or delete a picture.

Development: The app will be open source software developed for Android. The app uses the native components from Android. See mockup: http://benjaminhenn.de/letspicapp/mockup

More Ideas: Geo based reminder. For example: If get back home, a picture of my washing machine shows up => to peg out clothes :-)

Similar Apps: The Android app: „Fast Photo Notes“ ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pragmaticcoder ) It takes 4 steps to take a picture . Lets Pic app will do in one.

The app: „Meteror“ ( https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/meteor-take-photo-memos/id740977931?mt=8 ) for IOS. Can also auto delete pictures.

Any similar project on GitHub?
I need help to get started with the code and structure. Who can help?
